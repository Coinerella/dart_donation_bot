A simple bot that will monitor a Peercoin address for incoming tx / donations and mint events by connecting to a Electrum server.  
This bot will report those events to a given Discord channel.  
Transactions are persisted locally in a Hive database.

When starting for the first time, setting SILENT_OPERATION=true is recommended to avoid spam on initial build of the database.
